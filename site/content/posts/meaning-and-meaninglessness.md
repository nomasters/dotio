I've been thinking a lot about [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) lately. Maybe its the [online cryptography class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) I recently completed (I love you and you challenge me number theory); the ideas in [Godel's Proof](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/695429.G_del_s_Proof?from_search=true) still fresh in my mind (absurdity is a beautiful destroyer); or recently diving deeper into into trying to understand [quaternions [https://eater.net/quaternions] (hypercomplex number systems bend my brain), but I’ve been dwelling on thorughts about the emergence of meaning from seaming meaningless-ness.

What do I mean by this? Well, I’m not really concerned in getting into some sort of philosophical debate about [strong emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence#Strong_and_weak_emergence) vs [reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism). I personally tend towards favoring reductionism, myself. I’m more specifically talking about emergence in the sense of some sort of concept our minds latch on to that exists outside of the sum of the parts itself. This is a layman's exploration of this topic, some ideas I've scrounged together and that I've had fun thinking about. I'm sure there are holes in the logic and I'm making no claim to how the universe actually works.

So, if you're still with me, I’m about to be getting into some odd and abstract territory, so bear with me.

Under this sort of layman’s view I’m talking about things like the emergence of the mind from the body. We know that a mind (at least a human mind) requires the body. The machinery that manifests the mind seems to be strongly tied to the systems in and around the Brain. In a reductive sense: smash the brain, the mind is gone. But, oddly, our concept of the mind isn’t really bound by the body. Our perception of the mind exists in its own way. It has its own sort of meaning. We can imagine things like “the mind living on after we are dead” even if there isn’t the slightest ounce of evidence for this to be true. I am personally of the belief that my experience after death will mirror my experience before birth: I won’t have one. But that doesn't change the fact that we can imagine it. The idea of a immortal mind or soul or consciousness, these are powerful ideas that are deeply bound into the history and mythology of human history.

What’s interesting to me is that this seemingly odd fixation the mind has on thinking of itself outside of the bounds of its physical reality is linked deeply into how we think and interpret the world around us. To put it bluntly: I think that meaning itself is a figment of our imaginations. I think that any meaning in the universe may come from some sort of emergent system that we’ve cooked up in our heads.

Take cryptography for instance. We dance around these beautiful concepts of randomness. The dance being that a cipher can encrypt a message in such a way that its output is reasonably indiscernible from randomly generated output. And yet, if you plug in the right key and turn the dials just right, a perfectly preserved message emerges from the seeming randomness on the other side.

We took a chunk of something we deemed meaningful, folded it into something that seemed meaningless and then unfolded the hidden meaning again on the other side into something meaningful again.

Now take a step back and think about what we're actually working with here. We're playing parlour tricks with combinations of [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) bound to the causal limits of space-time. Our message, encrypted and decrypted is meaningless in all forms to the particles holding the state of the information we care about.

In an odd way, meaning seams to be a strange projection of the inner workings of the mind on the universe around us. And it doesn't appear to really play a role in the function of the universe itself outside of serving the mind. Its sort of this strange game we play, projecting all sorts of thoughts, intent, and purpose to everything around us, when in fact, none of it exists outside of the collective experience of the [human condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition).

I guess I should take a step back and show my cards. I have my doubts that the mind is evidence of a "universal mind". I think our need to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves is a strange artifact of the mind. I think its fascinating to think about the big questions that have been explored in religion and philosophy. I'm also not writing off the fact that consciousness may or may not be an inevitable part of complex biological systems, much like nuclear fission is an inevitable part of the shear gravitational mass of stars or chemical reactions are an inevitable part of the by product of the output of those stars.

But, I'm skeptical that any of this points to a deeper meaning of the universe or existence at all. Instead, I think those ideas are actually most likely projections of our own mind's need to process our sensory data and to connect to other minds.

What I like about this model of thinking is that it doesn't require an authority figure for the universe. It doesn't require any sort of "hidden truth" about our minds given to us by a creator. Instead the universe seems to be a complex system that built from fundamental parts. In a strange way it frees us up to derive meaning from nothing, which I find just: beautiful.
